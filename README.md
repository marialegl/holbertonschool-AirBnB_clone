## DESCRIPTION
It is a simple command interpreter to manage the objects used in the AirBnB clone project by:
 - Allowing for the creation of new objects.
 - Allows retrieval of an object from a file, a database, etc.
 - Allows operations to be performed on objects
 - Allows object attributes to be updated.
 - Allows objects to be destroyed.


## The project contains:
 - A parent class (called BaseModel) used for initialization, serialization, and deserialization of instances.
 - Creates a simple flow of serialization/deserialization, as follows: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
 - Creation of all subclasses ```User``` , ```State```, ```City```, ```Amenity```, ```Place```, ```Review```
 - Creation of a the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
 - Unittests to validate all classes as well as the storage engine.


## Command Interpreter ðŸ’»:
The command interpreter allows you to interact with the application to create, update, delete, and display instances of the different models in the database.

## How to Start
To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:

 - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.</li>
 - Run the following command:
```bash
./console.py
```

## How to Use
Once you've started the command interpreter, you can use the following commands:

 - ```create <model_name>```: Create a new instance of the specified model.
 - ```show <model_name> <id>```: Show the details of a specific instance of the model.
 - ```update <model_name> <id> <attribute> <value>```: Update a specific attribute of an instance of the model.
 - ```destroy <model_name> <id>```: Delete a specific instance of the model.
 - ```all <model_name>```: Show all instances of the specified model.
 - ```quit```: Exit the command interpreter.

## Examples

To create a new user:
```bash
(hbnb) create User
```

To list all users:
